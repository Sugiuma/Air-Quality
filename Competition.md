Here’s a refined overview of the **current air purifier competitors in India**, what customers praise, and the **gaps or shortcomings** you could potentially address with your product.

---

## 🏆 Major Brands & Strengths

### **Xiaomi (Mi Air Purifier series)**

* Affordable with quick purification, Wi-Fi and app control, and real‑time PM readings
  ([mint][1])
* Real‑time AQI display and smart connectivity (`Mi Home`, voice integration)
  ([IM Sunil Singh][2])

**Reported drawbacks:**

* Weak or absent pre‑filter leading to faster HEPA degradation

  > “Xiaomi … They say have a PreFilter but they actually have a very weak PreFilter.”
  > ([Reddit][3])
* Lock‑out behavior when filter life ends: seen as a gimmick
  ([Reddit][4])
* Mixed results for odor removal
  ([mint][1])

---

### **Coway (Airmega 150 / Aim)**

* Excellent HEPA filtration (often H13 grade), ultra‑quiet (as low as 22 dB), long filter life (\~8,500 hours), and strong support warranty
  ([mint][1])

**Reported drawbacks:**

* Auto mode may fluctuate, causing noise disturbances or unexpected fan changes

  > “Auto mode isn’t very peaceful, it keeps on fluctuating a lot…”
  > ([Reddit][5])
* Lack of auto-resume after power interruption in some models
  ([Reddit][5])
* Premium pricing: many perceive high upfront cost
  ([Reddit][3])

---

### **Philips & Sharp**

* Philips offers robust multi-stage filtration and accurate sensors (AeraSense, IPS), with excellent allergen/virus removal
  ([mint][6])
* Sharp’s Plasma Cluster Ion technology removes odors and allergens, with a modern design
  ([The New Indian Express][7])

**Reported drawbacks:**

* Philips filters need frequent replacing (every 6–9 months in high pollution areas)—adding to cost
  ([theappliancereviewer.com][8])
* Sharp filters are reportedly hard to source and expensive; some complaint about HEPA grade downgraded to H10‑H12
  ([Reddit][9])

---

### **Other brands**

* **Royal Fans** (local): cheap and basic, but unreliable quality, poor customer support, plastic smell, and short filter durability
  ([Reddit][10])
* **Qubo Air Purifiers**: often recommended for mid‑tier users as better performing than Honeywell and Xiaomi at similar price points
  ([Reddit][11])
* **Dyson**: premium, feature‑rich (hot + cool, VOC sensors, etc.) but very costly and lower value for money
  ([The New Indian Express][7], [The Economic Times][12], [Reddit][13])

## 🚧 Gaps & Opportunities for Your Product

Based on competitor reviews, here’s where you can position your product to stand out:

### 1. **Reliable Pre‑filter + longer lasting HEPA**

Xiaomi’s weak pre-filter leads to rapid HEPA wear. Provide a robust, replaceable pre‑filter to extend HEPA life.

### 2. **Stable Auto Mode**

Coway’s auto mode is inconsistent. Design smoother auto-control logic to avoid sudden fan speed jumps and improve user comfort.

### 3. **Affordable High-CADR with Quality Filters**

Offer competitive CADR with True HEPA (H13) plus activated carbon. Compete on value vs. Dyson/Philips with high performance at lower price.

### 4. **Transparent Filter Supply & Customer Service**

Address customer concerns about filter availability and quality—ensure long-term support and easy replacements.

### 5. **Low Noise at High Speeds**

Consumers dislike loud operation. Target sub‑30 dB performance in sleep/auto mode, especially in premium mid‑segment.

### 6. **Odor Handling**

Many users report poor odor elimination across brands. Improve VOC and odor filter effectiveness and highlight this feature.

### 7. **Clear User Experience**

Avoid lock-out gimmicks like Xiaomi; provide intuitive UI, reliable AQI display, and meaningful alerts without frustrating locks.

### &#x20;Narrative Summary

* In **Mysore**, short-term spikes in **NO₂** and **PM₁₀/PM₂.₅** are consistently associated with **increased daily hospital admissions** for children with asthma or wheezing. A 10 µg/m³ rise in NO₂ increases admissions by approximately 2.4% ([PubMed][1]).

* In **Delhi**, **winter months**—when AQI often enters the "very poor" category due to pollutants like PM₂.₅—see the **highest share of pediatric ER visits** for respiratory distress (\~41%) compared to other seasons ([NCBI][2]).

* Children living **near high-traffic roads** (with elevated **NO₂ and PM₁₀** exposure) show nearly **double the asthma exacerbation rate** compared to those in cleaner areas ([Lippincott Journals][3]).

* Broad **urban exposure to ambient PM₂.₅** and traffic-related NO₂ is strongly linked to **higher prevalence of asthma symptoms** among children, e.g. Delhi adolescents report asthma prevalence above 21% versus much lower rates in less polluted southern cities ([PMC][4], [researchmatters.in][5]).

* On a national scale, **about 350,000 new childhood asthma cases per year** in India are estimated to be attributable to **traffic-related NO₂ exposure** ([researchmatters.in][5], [Hindustan Times][6]).

### &#x20;Narrative Summary

* In **Mysore**, short-term spikes in **NO₂** and **PM₁₀/PM₂.₅** are consistently associated with **increased daily hospital admissions** for children with asthma or wheezing. A 10 µg/m³ rise in NO₂ increases admissions by approximately 2.4% ([PubMed][1]).

* In **Delhi**, **winter months**—when AQI often enters the "very poor" category due to pollutants like PM₂.₅—see the **highest share of pediatric ER visits** for respiratory distress (\~41%) compared to other seasons ([NCBI][2]).

* Children living **near high-traffic roads** (with elevated **NO₂ and PM₁₀** exposure) show nearly **double the asthma exacerbation rate** compared to those in cleaner areas ([Lippincott Journals][3]).

* Broad **urban exposure to ambient PM₂.₅** and traffic-related NO₂ is strongly linked to **higher prevalence of asthma symptoms** among children, e.g. Delhi adolescents report asthma prevalence above 21% versus much lower rates in less polluted southern cities ([PMC][4], [researchmatters.in][5]).

* On a national scale, **about 350,000 new childhood asthma cases per year** in India are estimated to be attributable to **traffic-related NO₂ exposure** ([researchmatters.in][5], [Hindustan Times][6]).

### 🔍 Assumptions & References:

* **Pediatric Population** in Delhi (age 6–14): Estimated from \~20% of total population (\~25M in 2025).
* **Asthma Prevalence**: Varies with AQI, based on spirometry-confirmed studies showing 8% in clean zones vs \~30–35% in polluted Delhi ([IRJMETS](https://www.irjmets.com/uploadedfiles/paper/issue_12_december_2024/65386/final/fin_irjmets1734671703.pdf)).
* **Hospitalization Rate**: Increases from 2% in clean air to up to 8% during severe spikes (based on Patna cohort and seasonal admissions studies).
* **Monthly Treatment Cost**: Includes outpatient visits, medication, and partial hospital-related costs. Cost estimates from [IJHCR](https://ijhcr.com/index.php/ijhcr/article/view/4962) and [PolicyX](https://www.policyx.com/health-insurance/articles/asthma-treatment-cost-in-india/).
* ₹1 Crore = ₹10,000,000



### 💡 Insights:

* Pediatric asthma costs **scale sharply** with pollution. Monthly spending under current conditions (\~₹30+ Cr) is **nearly 4×** that under clean-air baseline.
* A **single post-Diwali AQI spike period** could increase asthma burden by **\~₹150+ Cr** in just 3–4 months if ER visits and hospitalizations rise.
* Investments in **AQI control and preventive outreach (e.g., filter subsidies, indoor alerts, awareness apps)** could return **multiples in public health cost savings**.

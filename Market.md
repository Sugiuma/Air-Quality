Here’s a curated **market segment matching analysis** to identify Indian cities most promising for launching an air purifier—by combining **AQI severity**, **population size**, and **per capita income**. I’ve mapped the highest-potential urban centers based on publicly available insights.

## 🔍 Candidate Cities and Their Data

Using AQI, population, and income rankings from public sources:

* **Richest cities (by income)**: Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Pune, Surat, Kolkata, Jaipur ([voguebusiness.com][1])
* **Per capita income (approximate 2024–25)**: Delhi \~₹4.6 LPA, Mumbai \~₹4.1 LPA, Hyderabad \~₹4.0 LPA, Ahmedabad \~₹3.9 LPA, Pune \~₹2.8 LPA, Coimbatore \~₹5.9 LPA, Chennai \~₹5.2 LPA ([myjar.app][2], [reddit.com][3], [nobroker.in][4], [housing.com][5])

**High-AQI cities** generally include Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, etc.

\*AQI Rank based on city pollution monitoring reports (Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru consistently very high PM2.5)

---

## 🧠 Interpretation

* **Delhi**, **Mumbai**, **Bengaluru**, **Hyderabad**, and **Chennai** top the combined ranking—due to their high pollution levels, large populations, and high per capita incomes.
* **Ahmedabad**, **Pune**, and **Surat** also score well—they represent large, affluent metro clusters growing rapidly.
* **Coimbatore**, despite smaller population, scores due to above-average income and mid-high AQI.
* Cities like **Lucknow** have high pollution but lower income, reducing disposable market potential.

---

## 🚀 Strategic Recommendations

### ✅ Primary Target Tier

* **Delhi**
* **Mumbai**
* **Bengaluru**
* **Hyderabad**
* **Chennai**

These markets offer the highest combined demand and affordable income levels.

### ✅ Secondary Expansion Tier

* **Ahmedabad**
* **Pune**
* **Surat**
* **Coimbatore**

Ideal for targeted campaigns or regional pilots.

### ✅ Other Tier II Cities to Consider

City potential depends on stronger income or pollution metrics, but may require lower pricing or intense marketing.

## 🛠️ Example Python Workflow Outline

```python
# Merge your AQI dataset (city_avg) with population_df and income_df
merged = city_avg.merge(population_df, left_on="area", right_on="city")\
                 .merge(income_df, on="city")

# Score as before
merged['launch_score'] = merged.apply(score_city, axis=1)

# Sort and inspect top cities
top10 = merged.sort_values('launch_score', ascending=False).head(10)
```

Output this `top10` list to prioritize geography for product launch.

## ✅ Summary

Your best launch markets in India are the big metros: **Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai**, and strong-tier cities like **Ahmedabad, Pune, Surat**. These cities combine **high demand (AQI)** with **large population and sufficient purchasing power**, giving your air purifier the best opportunity to succeed.

Here's a practical and structured list of Indian cities grouped into:

1. **Tier 1 Cities** – Metropolitan hubs with high population density and pollution from vehicles, construction, and urban industry.
2. **Tier 2 Cities** – Fast-growing industrial/urban centers with increasing pollution.
3. **Pollution-Prone Industrial Cities** – Known for localized or seasonal high AQI, often missed in mainstream city lists but are critical for air purifier market targeting.

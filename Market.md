\*AQI Rank based on city pollution monitoring reports (Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru consistently very high PM2.5)

## üß† Interpretation

* **Delhi**, **Mumbai**, **Bengaluru**, **Hyderabad**, and **Chennai** top the combined ranking‚Äîdue to their high pollution levels, large populations, and high per capita incomes.
* **Ahmedabad**, **Pune**, and **Surat** also score well‚Äîthey represent large, affluent metro clusters growing rapidly.
* **Coimbatore**, despite smaller population, scores due to above-average income and mid-high AQI.
* Cities like **Lucknow** have high pollution but lower income, reducing disposable market potential.

---

## üöÄ Strategic Recommendations

### ‚úÖ Primary Target Tier

* **Delhi**
* **Mumbai**
* **Bengaluru**
* **Hyderabad**
* **Chennai**

These markets offer the highest combined demand and affordable income levels.

### ‚úÖ Secondary Expansion Tier

* **Ahmedabad**
* **Pune**
* **Surat**
* **Coimbatore**

Ideal for targeted campaigns or regional pilots.

### ‚úÖ Other Tier II Cities to Consider

City potential depends on stronger income or pollution metrics, but may require lower pricing or intense marketing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Example Python Workflow Outline

```python
# Merge your AQI dataset (city_avg) with population_df and income_df
merged = city_avg.merge(population_df, left_on="area", right_on="city")\
                 .merge(income_df, on="city")

# Score as before
merged['launch_score'] = merged.apply(score_city, axis=1)

# Sort and inspect top cities
top10 = merged.sort_values('launch_score', ascending=False).head(10)
```

Output this `top10` list to prioritize geography for product launch.

## ‚úÖ Summary

Your best launch markets in India are the big metros: **Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai**, and strong-tier cities like **Ahmedabad, Pune, Surat**. These cities combine **high demand (AQI)** with **large population and sufficient purchasing power**, giving your air purifier the best opportunity to succeed.

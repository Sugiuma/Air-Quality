Great question — and yes, it can go much further. An **AI-enabled product recommender for air purifiers** can be a smart feature that personalizes product suggestions *based on data like AQI trends, city population, income, and even user health preferences*. Here’s what such a system can do, and how:

---

### 🧠 **What is an AI-enabled Air Purifier Recommender?**

It’s a **machine learning or rules-based engine** that suggests:

* **Which model** of air purifier a user should buy
* **What features** it must have (e.g., PM2.5 filter, activated carbon, HEPA, UV)
* **Where** to launch it or market it more aggressively (city targeting)
* **When** to recommend seasonal offers (e.g., winter AQI spikes)

### 📊 **Inputs It Can Use**

| Input                         | Source                                |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| City-level AQI trends         | Your existing dataset                 |
| Dominant pollutant types      | (PM2.5, PM10, NO₂ etc.)               |
| Population & household income | Census, World Bank, CMIE, MOSPI       |
| Health burden data            | ICMR, WHO, state health data          |
| Consumer preferences          | Survey, Google Trends, online reviews |
| Competition analysis          | Manual feature table from websites    |
| Weather/humidity              | OpenWeatherMap API                    |

### 🧩 **How the Recommendation Works**

**Scenario**: A user is in **Delhi**, has moderate income, and AQI trends show high PM2.5 and SO₂ in winter.

Your AI model (or rule engine) can recommend:

* ✅ A mid-range purifier
* ✅ Features: **HEPA + activated carbon**, timer-based usage, smart AQI display
* ✅ Add-on: Pediatric or elderly health mode
* ✅ Marketing Message: *“Protect your family from winter pollution in Delhi. Specially tuned for PM2.5.”*

### 🔧 **How to Build It (Starter Ideas)**

1. **Rule-Based MVP**

   * IF `PM2.5 > 150 AND Income < ₹10L` THEN Recommend mid-range HEPA + Carbon model.
   * You can build this using a simple decision tree or logic in Python.

2. **ML-Based Recommender (Optional)**

   * Train a model (classification/regression) on:

     * Past sales data (if you simulate it)
     * Location + AQI + health burden → Suggested model

3. **Advanced: LLM Chat Assistant**

   * Embed your product catalog + AQI data
   * Let users chat: *“What’s the best purifier for Bangalore in winter with a 20K budget?”*

### 🧠 Unique Add-on Ideas

* **Filter Subscription Planner**: Recommends replacement schedules based on AQI + usage.
* **Map-based Planner**: City map with pins saying: *Launch premium model here*, *avoid here*, etc.
* **B2B Recommender**: For schools/hospitals needing industrial purifiers.

### ✅ Want a prototype of this?

I can help you:

* Design a recommender logic using your existing AQI + city data
* Package it with a minimal Streamlit UI (choose city, get product)
* Or build a rules JSON / decision tree you can expand later

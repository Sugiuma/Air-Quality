### Growth Trends: Air Purifier Sales in High-Pollution Indian Cities

- **Consistent High Growth:** The Indian air purifier market has experienced robust growth, especially in highly polluted cities like Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata. Delhi accounts for about 38% of India's total air purifier sales, with per capita spending on purifiers over three times the national average[1]. The market reached an estimated $507.5 million in 2024, projected to rise to $1.8 billion by 2033, with a CAGR exceeding 14%[2][3].
- **Sales Spikes Linked to Pollution Events:** Sales data and manufacturer statements show strong seasonal sales spikes, especially during periods when air quality deteriorates—commonly in late autumn and winter, due to stubble burning and Diwali fireworks. For example, in Q3 2023 alone, air purifier sales surged by 64% year-over-year nationally, driven by AQI exceeding 300 in Delhi NCR and other metros[4]. Around Diwali and high pollution episodes, leading brands reported 10x increases in sales within single weeks, and 15-20% demand rises in just 4-5 days[5]. Manufacturers like Kent, Xiaomi, and LG have confirmed demand surges up to 50% as AQI reaches hazardous levels, with a similar trend in 2024[6][7][8].
- **Region-Specific Insights:**
  - **Delhi NCR:** Nearly 80% of commercial buildings may now have air purification systems. Seasonal peaks—October-November—see up to 50% increases in sales as winter pollution sets in[1][7][8].
  - **Maharashtra (Mumbai):** Fastest growth market, often paralleling Delhi in sales spikes; online sales up 142% from 2020-2023[1].

### Correlation: AQI Events & Consumer Behavior

- **Sales Correlate Directly with AQI Spikes:** Manufacturers and market trackers report that air purifier sales and search/interest surge immediately when AQI worsens, particularly when news headlines highlight hazardous smog or AQI crosses the 300–500 range in Delhi, Mumbai, and northern cities[5][6][7][8][4]. For example, Q3 2023 shipment data revealed a 64% YoY growth for purifiers as pollution soared[4].
- **Consumer Sentiment:** Companies like Philips, Xiaomi, and Dyson report double-digit sales growth and up to a 200% quarter-over-quarter increase for specific models as pollution headlines trend[4][5]. Greater health awareness, media coverage, and government advisories amplify spikes in purchasing.

### Datasets and Data Sources

- **Shipment and Sales Trackers:** Industry shipment trackers (such as 6Wresearch, AC Nielsen India, and ESC) aggregate quarterly and seasonal detailed sales and market share, including spikes aligned with AQI events[4][1].
- **Public Market Reports:** Third-party research platforms (e.g., IMARC Group, Renub Research, Ken Research) regularly publish market size, growth rates, and city-specific trends, often providing digital dashboards or data tables with year-wise or even monthly breakdowns[2][1][3][9].
- **No Open Raw Retail Dataset, But…** While comprehensive, open-access raw datasets directly correlating AQI and sales aren’t public, you can analyze:
  - **Government AQI data** (CPCB, SAFAR, Open Government Data)
  - **E-commerce air purifier sales rankings** during spike periods (from Amazon, Flipkart—using price/comparison scrapers, or by request from retailers)
  - **Google Trends** for search term frequency: “air purifier” vs. AQI headlines

### Key Insights—Actionable Takeaways

- **Market is highly sensitive to acute pollution events**; air purifier purchases in India are still highly event- and news-driven.
- Companies and analysts confirm **direct causality between AQI surges and spikes in air purifier sales**, with the largest growth in Delhi NCR and other high-pollution metros[5][1][4].
- **Sales generally peak October–November** but seasonal highs may occur whenever air quality deteriorates rapidly and media coverage increases public concern.
- **Tracking AQI and local sales data together** (e.g., sales by region vs. AQI) provides a strong foundation for analyzing market fit and forecasting demand.

from above data we can see

| City       | Sales Trend Insight                               |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Delhi**  | Highest demand during **Oct–Nov**, AQI 400+ zone  |
| **Mumbai** | Moderate year-round, small peak in festive season |
| **Tier2**  | Slower growth, seasonal awareness rising          |



| Trend Insight                   | Translated Into Rule Parameter    |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| "High Oct–Nov demand in Delhi"       | `season: [10,11], boost: 0.25`    |
| "AQI 400+ = strong spikes"           | `threshold: 300, multiplier: 2.5` |
| "Mumbai has milder but present rise" | `threshold: 250, multiplier: 1.8` |
| "Tier2 growing slowly"               | `base: 200, boost: 0.1`           |

**exploratory product-market fit** 

Used historical AQI data and observed seasonal trends in purifier interest to build heuristic-based demand rules.


**Higher AQI = higher purifier demand**

* A **threshold AQI**, above which demand starts to spike
* A **multiplier** to exaggerate that rise

| City   | Threshold AQI | Why this value?                        | Multiplier | Why this value?               |
| ------ | ------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| Delhi  | 300           | Regularly sees AQI > 300 during winter | 2.5        | High demand due to severe AQI |
| Mumbai | 250           | Moderate AQI, but sensitive population | 1.8        | Demand rises but less sharply |
| Tier2  | 200           | Mild AQI, people less proactive        | 1.5        | Demand grows slower           |

**Seasonality Boost (October & November)**
These months align with:
* 🌫️ Post-monsoon stubble burning (esp. North India)
* 💨 Pollution buildup during festive season (Diwali)
* 🧑‍⚕️ Health concern awareness peaks

Apply a seasonal **boost factor** for those months:

| City   | Seasonality Boost | Reason                                 |
| ------ | ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Delhi  | 25% extra demand  | AQI often 400–500+                     |
| Mumbai | 15%               | Festivals, urban dust, indoor concern  |
| Tier2  | 10%               | Growing awareness, rising urbanization |

**Base Demand**
This is an **estimated monthly average** number of purifier units sold or searched:

| City   | Base Demand | Why?                       |
| ------ | ----------- | -------------------------- |
| Delhi  | 1000        | Capital city, health-aware |
| Mumbai | 500         | Dense population, humid    |
| Tier2  | 200         | Smaller market, steady     |


| **Data Used**                            | **How its used**                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AQI history per city                        | Use real data - aqi.csv                                |
| Known spikes (from trend description)  | Encode event windows (e.g., Diwali week, stubble burning months) |
| Sales growth trends (e.g., 64% YoY Q3) | Use as multipliers to generate synthetic `sales` column          |
| Future AQI forecast (using Prophet)         | Drive projected demand from future AQI                           |

So by forecasting AQI values and applying business rules to interpret spikes and seasonal effects, generate dynamic, city-specific demand predictions that can guide production, marketing, and inventory planning.

## Demand Prediction Logic

The predicted AQI values from Prophet are then used to estimate **air purifier demand** based on the following business logic:

* **Base Demand:** A user-configurable baseline demand level.
* **AQI Threshold:** A user-defined AQI value beyond which demand is expected to spike.
* **Multiplier:** A factor that increases demand when AQI crosses the threshold.
* **Seasonal Boost:** Additional demand multiplier for specific months with historically high pollution or sales (e.g., October and November for festivals or stubble burning).

### Demand Calculation per Month

For each month in the forecast:

```python
demand = base
if AQI > threshold:
    demand *= multiplier
if month in seasonal_months:
    demand *= (1 + seasonal_boost)
```
The resulting demand is an integer representing the predicted number of units consumers will require.

**Time Series Plot:** A combined line plot shows:

  * Forecasted AQI values (`AQI`)
  * Corresponding predicted demand (`Predicted Demand`)
    
* This visualization helps stakeholders understand how air quality trends drive demand changes.

Based on the forecasted AQI severity, the system dynamically recommends appropriate **air purifier filter types**:

| AQI Range | Air Quality Level | Recommended Filters                                      |
| --------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0 - 100   | Good              | HEPA                                                     |
| 101 - 200 | Moderate          | HEPA + Activated Carbon                                  |
| 201 - 300 | Poor              | HEPA + Activated Carbon + UV                             |
| 301 - 400 | Very Poor         | HEPA + Activated Carbon + UV + Pre-filter                |
| 401+      | Severe            | HEPA + Activated Carbon + UV + Pre-filter + Ozone Filter |

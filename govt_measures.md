## Government Steps to Lower Pollution in India

**India has implemented a multi-pronged approach to address air pollution:**  
- **National Clean Air Programme (NCAP):** Launched in 2019 to target a 20–30% reduction in particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) concentrations by 2024, using 2017 as the baseline. The NCAP covers 131 non-attainment cities and provides significant funding for air quality monitoring, city action plans, and public awareness[1][2][3][4].
- **Emission Standards:** Stricter standards for industry (National Ambient Air Quality Standards, or NAAQS) and vehicles (BS-VI emission norms) have been enforced to reduce emissions at the source[1][2][5].
- **Cleaner Fuels and Renewable Energy:** Promotion of LPG for cooking (replacing biomass), targeting 500 GW of renewable electricity by 2030, and subsidies for clean energy[1][6][5].
- **Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP):** Implemented in cities like Delhi-NCR, GRAP activates stricter measures during high-pollution periods, including construction dust control, waste management, restricting vehicular and industrial activity, and public advisories[7][5].
- **Waste Management Initiatives:** Door-to-door waste segregation, composting, promotion of recycling, and strict industrial waste enforcement help control open burning and landfill emissions[2].
- **Technological and Data-Driven Solutions:** Investment in large-scale continuous air quality monitoring networks, use of machine learning/AI for pollution prediction, real-time public air quality updates, and even pioneering emissions trading in states like Gujarat[8][9].
- **Urban Greening and Public Transit Upgrades:** Expanding green spaces and encouraging e-vehicles and public transportation as alternatives to private vehicle use[1][5].


**Conclusion:**  
India’s anti-pollution drive is robust but implementation and enforcement are mixed across regions. Using the right data—including ambient and indoor air quality metrics, health trends, and consumer behavior—will provide evidence-based insights into the effectiveness of government efforts and the market opportunity for air purifiers[1][2][3][10].

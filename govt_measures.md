To answer **which pollution control policies introduced by the Indian government in the past 5 years have had the most measurable impact on improving air quality**, and how those **impacts varied across regions or cities**, you’ll need to do a **policy impact assessment** that combines **environmental data analysis** with **policy timelines**.

### 🧭 Step-by-Step Plan

---

## 🧩 Step 1: Identify Key Policies (2019–2024)

Create a timeline of central and state-level **air pollution control policies**:

| Policy                                               | Year                   | Description                                              | Target Area                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **National Clean Air Programme (NCAP)**              | 2019                   | Aim to reduce PM2.5/PM10 by 20-30% by 2024 in 131 cities | Pan-India (non-attainment cities) |
| **BS-VI Emission Norms**                             | 2020                   | Replaced BS-IV with stricter vehicle emissions norms     | Nationwide                        |
| **GRAP (Graded Response Action Plan)**               | Ongoing (revised 2022) | Emergency measures for Delhi NCR                         | Delhi NCR                         |
| **SAFAR Initiative**                                 | Expanded post-2020     | AQI monitoring & forecasting system                      | Metro cities                      |
| **State-specific bans on firecrackers/open burning** | Various                | Seasonal curbs                                           | Delhi, West Bengal, etc.          |
| **Switch to cleaner fuels (e.g., PNG)**              | Expanded post-2019     | Industrial clusters moved to gas                         | Surat, Ahmedabad, Delhi, etc.     |

You can extract this data from:

* [MoEFCC Annual Reports](http://moef.gov.in)
* [CPCB](https://cpcb.nic.in/)
* NCAP Tracker ([https://ncap.indiaaq.in](https://ncap.indiaaq.in))
* Research papers on policy impact (via Google Scholar)

## 📊 Step 2: Collect AQI and PM Data (City-Level)

Get yearly air quality metrics for 2018–2024:

| Source                                                                                | Type of Data                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| [OpenAQ](https://openaq.org/)                                                         | PM2.5, PM10, NO2, O3 (city/station level) |
| [CPCB AQI Dashboard](https://app.cpcbccr.com/ccr/#/caaqm-dashboard-all/caaqm-landing) | Real-time & historic AQI                  |
| [UrbanEmissions.info](http://www.urbanemissions.info/)                                | Pollution source apportionment            |
| [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/)                                   | Health & environment indicators           |

Use Python with `pandas` + `plotly`/`seaborn` to preprocess and visualize.

## 🔍 Step 3: Match Policy Timelines to AQI Trends

### Example Analysis:

**Delhi - BS-VI Rollout (2020):**

```python
# Compare PM2.5 in Delhi before and after BS-VI
pm25 = df[(df["city"]=="Delhi") & (df["parameter"]=="pm25")]
pm25.groupby("year")["value"].mean().plot()
```

You can do:

* **Interrupted time series analysis**: Did the policy cause a significant change in trend?
* **Before-After plots** for specific cities
* **Counterfactuals**: Compare cities with similar pollution profiles, but without the policy (e.g., Delhi vs. Kanpur if one had stricter enforcement)

---

## 🗺️ Step 4: Compare Regional Impacts

Create a heatmap or bubble chart:

```python
import plotly.express as px
fig = px.scatter_geo(df, locations="city", locationmode="country names",
                     color="avg_pm25_change", size="population",
                     hover_name="city", title="PM2.5 Reduction (2019–2024)")
```

You can show:

* **Cities with most improvement** (e.g., Varanasi, Lucknow saw 20–25% PM2.5 drop)
* **Cities with least improvement** (e.g., Ghaziabad, Delhi NCR still highly polluted)

---

## 📌 Step 5: Summarize Findings by Policy

For each major policy, summarize:

* **Cities targeted**
* **Before vs. after AQI**
* **PM2.5/10 trends**
* **Limitations or confounders** (e.g., COVID lockdowns, weather)

> Example: *"NCAP cities like Ahmedabad and Pune showed 15–20% decline in PM2.5 over 5 years, while non-NCAP cities saw only 5–8%. However, meteorological variations and COVID lockdowns also contributed to temporary drops."*

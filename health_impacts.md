| **Newborns & Children <5**     | Mortality risk >2× in districts exceeding PM₂.₅ limits; increased stunting, anemia, ARI due to pollution.  |
| **Young Adults (18–30)**       | High rates of respiratory symptoms during pollution episodes; loss in school/work productivity.            |
| **Middle-aged & Older Adults** | Elevated frailty and cognitive decline risk from indoor biomass smoke; long-term pollution → higher mortality. |
| **Overall**                    | Health burden spans all ages; requires age-targeted interventions.                                          |

## Public Awareness Data

### a) **Perception Surveys**

* A 2018 Clean Air Collective study (17 cities including Delhi‑NCR, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Patna, Lucknow, Varanasi) showed:

  * \~90 % of respondents were aware of “air pollution” overall
  * But only \~54 % recognized the term “AQI,” 29.6 % PM2.5, and \~18 % PM10 ([arXiv][1], [Carbon Copy][2])

Use this as your baseline for **Tier‑1** and many **Tier‑2** cities.

### b) **City Tiers & Pollutant Trends**

* Tier‑1: Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Bangalore, Kolkata, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Pune, Hyderabad
* Tier‑2: Capitals and large cities like Lucknow, Patna, Chandigarh, Bhopal, Jaipur, etc. ([Reddit][3], [PMC][4])

### c) **Supplemental Awareness Campaign Data**

* Example: Delhi’s *MY Bharat* student-based awareness program spanning 130 cities with structured monthly outreach via schools and eco‑clubs ([The Times of India][5])

| **Kolkata**   | 75–80%                             | Urban net access improving rapidly, but rural outskirts pull avg. down                                                                                                                          |

---

### 🧠 Key Points:

* **Urban digital divide is shrinking**, but still exists in peripheral zones.
* Penetration is highest in **Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore**, and **Hyderabad**.
* **Mobile internet** is the dominant access mode (\~97%+ in metros).

---

### ✅ Use in Code (Example)

```python
internet_penetration_city = {
    "Delhi": 0.88,
    "Mumbai": 0.85,
    "Bangalore": 0.85,
    "Chennai": 0.83,
    "Hyderabad": 0.84,
    "Kolkata": 0.78
}
```

Then use:

```python
estimated_awareness = (search_score / 100) * internet_penetration_city[city]
```

Would you like to overlay this with your Google Trends data in a bar or heatmap chart to visualize **city-wise AQI awareness potential**?


Here are the **approximate internet penetration rates** for the major **Southern Indian states**—based on the most recent public data (TRAI, IAMAI/Kantar, DataReportal, NFHS)—along with a useful reference table you can plug into your awareness model.

---

## 🌐 Internet Penetration Estimates for Southern States (2023–2024)

| State              | Penetration Rate (% of population) | Notes / Source                                                                                                     |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Kerala**         | \~ 69–71%                          | Highest in India after Delhi ([GrabOn][1])                                                                         |
| **Telangana**      | \~ 83%                             | Second only to Kerala nationally ([The Times of India][2], [Wikipedia][3])                                         |
| **Karnataka**      | \~ 68%                             | Among top penetration rates in 2023–24 ([The Times of India][2], [RSA Regions][4])                                 |
| **Tamil Nadu**     | \~ 67%                             | High urban & rural coverage; state digital initiative ([Wikipedia][5], [RSA Regions][4])                           |
| **Andhra Pradesh** | \~ 59%                             | \~67.1 million internet subscribers in 2023; \~60%+ penetration estimate ([Wikipedia][6], [The Times of India][2]) |

---

### ✅ How to Use these in your Python Code

```python
internet_reach_south = {
    "Kerala": 0.70,
    "Telangana": 0.83,
    "Karnataka": 0.68,
    "Tamil Nadu": 0.67,
    "Andhra Pradesh": 0.59
}
```

You can then compute:

```python
estimated_awareness_percent = (float(search_interest) / 100) * internet_reach_south[state] * 100
```

— where `search_interest` is your Google Trends score.

---

### 🧠 Why These Estimates Matter

* These rates combine **NFHS gendered figures** and **state-level internet subscriber data** from TRAI and IAMAI to produce consensus figures.
* Kerala and Telangana top the list due to both urban saturation and strong digital infrastructure.
* Andhra Pradesh lags slightly behind but still ranks among **India’s high-penetration southern states**.

Here are the latest **estimated internet penetration rates** for your top‑10 states, which you can use to refine awareness analysis:

---

### 🌐 Internet Penetration by State (Percent of Population)

Based on aggregated data from TRAI, IAMAI, DataReportal, and other public sources as of early–mid 2024:

| State          | Internet Penetration (%) |
| -------------- | ------------------------ |
| Delhi          | \~74 – 85%               |
| Haryana        | \~60 – 72%               |
| Punjab         | \~55 – 78%               |
| West Bengal    | \~46 – 67%               |
| Rajasthan      | \~37 – 66%               |
| Uttar Pradesh  | \~30 – 59%               |
| Madhya Pradesh | \~27 – 56%               |
| Odisha         | \~25 – 51%               |
| Assam          | \~28 – 43%               |
| Bihar          | \~20 – 44%               |

**Notes:**

* Delhi tops the list at **63.8 % female and 85.2 % male users**, with combined penetration around **74 – 85 %** ([FindEasy][1])
* Bihar registers the lowest estimates at around **20.6 % female and 43.6 % male**, implying **\~30–37 % penetration** ([FindEasy][1], [GrabOn][2])
* States like **Punjab, Haryana, Kerala, Maharashtra** report higher figures (in the **upper 60–70 %** range) ([FindEasy][1], [GrabOn][2])
* National-level average is around **52.4 %** in early 2024 ([DataReportal – Global Digital Insights][3])

---

### ✅ How to Apply in Code

Use these approximate penetration rates in your Python model like so:

```python
internet_reach = {
    "Delhi": 0.80,
    "Haryana": 0.66,
    "Punjab": 0.70,
    "West Bengal": 0.55,
    "Rajasthan": 0.52,
    "Uttar Pradesh": 0.45,
    "Madhya Pradesh": 0.42,
    "Odisha": 0.38,
    "Assam": 0.36,
    "Bihar": 0.30
}
```

Then calculate:

```python
awareness_percent = (search_interest / 100) * internet_reach[state] * 100
```

---

### 📌 Why These Are Estimates Only

* State-level granular penetration isn't publicly released annually. Data sources like IAMAI ICUBE and TRAI provide samples or segmented demographics.
* Rural–urban digital gaps remain significant; rates vary internally within a state.
* There's a gender dimension: urban males often outpace rural females.

---

Would you like assistance creating a **table or dashboard** that combines Google Trends data with these internet rates to estimate **state-by-state awareness percentages**? If you have more recent per‑state data, I can help incorporate that, too.

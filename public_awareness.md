You can estimate **public awareness of poor AQI and related health effects** in India’s **Tier‑1 and Tier‑2 cities** using a blend of data sources and computational analysis. Here's a roadmap:

---

## 📦 1. Where to Get Public Awareness Data

### a) **Perception Surveys**

* A 2018 Clean Air Collective study (17 cities including Delhi‑NCR, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Patna, Lucknow, Varanasi) showed:

  * \~90 % of respondents were aware of “air pollution” overall
  * But only \~54 % recognized the term “AQI,” 29.6 % PM2.5, and \~18 % PM10 ([arXiv][1], [Carbon Copy][2])

Use this as your baseline for **Tier‑1** and many **Tier‑2** cities.

### b) **City Tiers & Pollutant Trends**

* Tier‑1: Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Bangalore, Kolkata, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Pune, Hyderabad
* Tier‑2: Capitals and large cities like Lucknow, Patna, Chandigarh, Bhopal, Jaipur, etc. ([Reddit][3], [PMC][4])

### c) **Supplemental Awareness Campaign Data**

* Example: Delhi’s *MY Bharat* student-based awareness program spanning 130 cities with structured monthly outreach via schools and eco‑clubs ([The Times of India][5])

---

## 🔍 2. Analytical Framework & Python Code Example

You can combine:

* Survey data (awareness percentages)
* Keyword search trends (e.g. Google Trends)
* Social media volume & sentiment (e.g. Twitter/X)
* Outreach activity data (e.g. school programs by city)
* News coverage volume

### Example Python Pipeline (pseudo-code):

```python
import pandas as pd
from pytrends.request import TrendReq
import snscrape.modules.twitter as sntwitter
from sklearn.preprocessing import minmax_scale

# 1. Survey data: load manually from Clean Air study or a newer one
survey = pd.read_csv('awareness_survey.csv')  # city, pct_heard_pollution, pct_heard_AQI

# 2. Google Trends: search interest for 'AQI' by Indian city
pytrends = TrendReq()
city_interest = []
for city in survey['city']:
    kw = pytrends.build_payload([f"{city} AQI", "PM2.5"], geo='IN', timeframe='today 12-m')
    df = pytrends.interest_by_region(resolution='CITY')
    city_interest.append(df.loc[city, "AQI"])

survey['search_index'] = city_interest

# 3. Twitter X mentions volume per city
def count_tweets(city, term, since='2024-01-01'):
    query = f'{term} near:"{city}, India" since:{since}'
    return sum(1 for _ in sntwitter.TwitterSearchScraper(query).get_items() if _)

survey['tweet_count'] = [count_tweets(city, 'AQI') for city in survey['city']]

# 4. School outreach: load or estimate counts (e.g. Delhi's 130 cities data)
outreach = pd.read_csv('my_bharat_outreach.csv')  # city, events
survey = survey.merge(outreach, on='city', how='left').fillna(0)

# Normalize indicators between 0–1
for col in ['pct_heard_AQI','search_index','tweet_count','events']:
    survey[col+'_norm'] = minmax_scale(survey[col])

# Composite awareness score
survey['awareness_score'] = (
    0.4 * survey['pct_heard_AQI_norm'] +
    0.3 * survey['search_index_norm'] +
    0.2 * survey['tweet_count_norm'] +
    0.1 * survey['events_norm']
)

survey[['city','awareness_score']].sort_values('awareness_score', ascending=False)
```

You can tweak:

* Weights (e.g. more weight on direct survey responses vs. social media)
* Timeframes & keywords (could use “air purifier”, “mask”, “PM2.5 health”)
* Sentiment analysis on tweets/posts to gauge depth of awareness or concern

---

## 📊 3. Building a Dashboard

Using the resulting `survey` DataFrame:

* **Map**: display cities colored by awareness score
* **Bar plot**: scores by tier (Tier‑1 vs Tier‑2)
* **Time series**: trends in search/tweet volume over time

You could use:

* Plotly/Folium (Python)
* Dash or Streamlit for interactivity
* Add public health metrics: local AQI exposure, hospital admission rates for respiratory issues (if available)

---

## 🧪 4. Additional Considerations

* **Local vs national** survey sources: The 2018 study is dated; you may need to commission new data or find more recent local surveys.
* **COVID-era responses** may affect pollutant awareness and mask usage, especially in Tier‑2 cities ([societyforindoorenvironment.org][6], [PMC][7], [arXiv][8], [Reddit][9], [The Times of India][5], [The Hindu][10], [PMC][4]).
* **Field pilots**: innovations like “pollution walks” (live PM2.5 measurement and pre/post surveys) have proven effective in raising awareness in cities like Kolkata ([gc.copernicus.org][11]).

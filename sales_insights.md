Yes ‚Äî your **sales trend input** was the **main guiding factor** for building the rules.

Let‚Äôs break it down:

---

### üì• What You Provided:

You mentioned **general sales behavior** across cities ‚Äî for example:

| City       | Sales Trend Insight                               |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Delhi**  | Highest demand during **Oct‚ÄìNov**, AQI 400+ zone  |
| **Mumbai** | Moderate year-round, small peak in festive season |
| **Tier2**  | Slower growth, seasonal awareness rising          |

You didn‚Äôt give exact numbers, but that‚Äôs okay ‚Äî trends are often enough for **rule-of-thumb modeling**.

---

### üß† What I Did With It:

I translated your **qualitative sales trends** into this **quantitative rule structure**:

| Your Trend Insight                   | Translated Into Rule Parameter    |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| "High Oct‚ÄìNov demand in Delhi"       | `season: [10,11], boost: 0.25`    |
| "AQI 400+ = strong spikes"           | `threshold: 300, multiplier: 2.5` |
| "Mumbai has milder but present rise" | `threshold: 250, multiplier: 1.8` |
| "Tier2 growing slowly"               | `base: 200, boost: 0.1`           |

---

### üß™ Why This Works:

This approach mimics **real-world market modeling**, often done when:

* Detailed sales data is **missing or partial**
* You want to **simulate** or **pitch** a working dashboard to stakeholders
* You're doing **exploratory product-market fit** work

---

### ‚úÖ What You Can Tell Clients:

> "We used historical AQI data and observed seasonal trends in purifier interest to build heuristic-based demand rules for Delhi, Mumbai, and Tier-2 markets. These are adjustable, and we can further fine-tune them once actual sales data becomes available."

---

Would you like to:

* Add user-tunable sliders for thresholds/multipliers in Streamlit?
* Build a second model that **learns these rules from synthetic sales data**?

Great question! These `rules` are **domain-informed heuristics**, meaning they are **manually set** using:

---

## üîß 1. **AQI-Based Demand Sensitivity**

We assume **higher AQI = higher purifier demand**. So we define:

* A **threshold AQI**, above which demand starts to spike
* A **multiplier** to exaggerate that rise

| City   | Threshold AQI | Why this value?                        | Multiplier | Why this value?               |
| ------ | ------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| Delhi  | 300           | Regularly sees AQI > 300 during winter | 2.5        | High demand due to severe AQI |
| Mumbai | 250           | Moderate AQI, but sensitive population | 1.8        | Demand rises but less sharply |
| Tier2  | 200           | Mild AQI, people less proactive        | 1.5        | Demand grows slower           |

---

## üçÇ 2. **Seasonality Boost (October & November)**

These months align with:

* üå´Ô∏è Post-monsoon stubble burning (esp. North India)
* üí® Pollution buildup during festive season (Diwali)
* üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Health concern awareness peaks

So, we apply a seasonal **boost factor** for those months:

| City   | Seasonality Boost | Reason                                 |
| ------ | ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Delhi  | 25% extra demand  | AQI often 400‚Äì500+                     |
| Mumbai | 15%               | Festivals, urban dust, indoor concern  |
| Tier2  | 10%               | Growing awareness, rising urbanization |

---

## üí∞ 3. **Base Demand**

This is an **estimated monthly average** number of purifier units sold or searched:

| City   | Base Demand | Why?                       |
| ------ | ----------- | -------------------------- |
| Delhi  | 1000        | Capital city, health-aware |
| Mumbai | 500         | Dense population, humid    |
| Tier2  | 200         | Smaller market, steady     |

---

## üìå Summary

These numbers are:

* **Not exact** ‚Äî they simulate realistic market behavior
* **Adjustable** ‚Äî you can tweak based on real-world sales when available
* **Good enough** to create **presentable, data-driven visualizations** for client/demo use

---

Would you like to make this rule system **dynamic**, so users can change thresholds/multipliers in the dashboard via sliders or sidebars?

| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AQI history per city                        | Use real data (CPCB, Open AQI)                                   |
| Known spikes (from your trend description)  | Encode event windows (e.g., Diwali week, stubble burning months) |
| Your sales growth trends (e.g., 64% YoY Q3) | Use as multipliers to generate synthetic `sales` column          |
| Future AQI forecast (using Prophet)         | Drive projected demand from future AQI                           |
